# VoiceBlender API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/v1`

All responses are `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Asynchronous endpoints

Every endpoint that triggers a SIP request or response (e.g. INVITE, BYE, re-INVITE for hold/unhold, REFER for transfer, 100/180/183/200 for inbound calls) is **asynchronous**. The HTTP handler validates inputs synchronously (returning 4xx if anything fails up front) then queues the SIP work on a goroutine and returns **`202 Accepted`** with a progressive-form status string (e.g. `holding`, `unholding`, `hanging_up`, `early_media`, `ringing`, `answering`).

The actual outcome of the SIP-level work is observed via webhook/WebSocket events:

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `leg.connected`, `leg.early_media`, `leg.hold`, `leg.unhold`, `leg.disconnected`, `leg.transfer_*` | Successful completion |
| `leg.command_failed` | The SIP-level work failed *after* the HTTP `202` was returned. Payload: `{leg_id, command, error}` where `command` is one of `ring`, `early_media`, `hold`, `unhold`, `add_to_room`, etc. |

GET endpoints, in-memory state-change endpoints (`/mute`, `/deaf`, `/dtmf/accept`, `/dtmf/reject`), audio-pipeline endpoints (`/play`, `/record`, `/tts`, `/stt`, `/agent/*`), `/dtmf` (sends RTP, not SIP), and room CRUD remain synchronous.

## Legs

A **leg** represents one side of a voice call — a SIP dialog, a WebRTC peer connection, a WhatsApp call, or a WebSocket session.

### Leg Object

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

| `deaf` | boolean | `true` if the leg is deaf (cannot hear others) |
| `held` | boolean | `true` if the call is on hold (SIP legs only) |
| `sip_headers` | object | Deprecated — `X-*` headers from the inbound INVITE. Only present on `sip_inbound` legs. Use `headers` for new code. |
| `headers` | object | Custom protocol headers exposed by the leg's transport — `X-`/`P-` headers from a SIP INVITE, WebSocket handshake, or supplied at outbound dial time. |

### POST /v1/legs

Originate an outbound SIP call.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "type": "sip",

    "total_analysis_time": 5000,
    "minimum_word_length": 100,
    "beep_timeout": 10000
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `"sip"` or `"whatsapp"` (see [WhatsApp Business Calling](#whatsapp-business-calling) below) |
| `to` | string | yes | Destination. For `sip` legs, a SIP URI (e.g. `"sip:alice@example.com"`). For `whatsapp` legs, an E.164 phone number (with or without `+`). |
| `uri` | string | no | Deprecated alias for `to` (sip legs only). Kept for backward compat; prefer `to`. |
| `from` | string | no | Caller ID — sets the user part of the SIP From header (e.g. `"+15551234567"`, `"alice"`) |
| `privacy` | string | no | SIP Privacy header value (e.g. `"id"`, `"none"`) |
| `ring_timeout` | integer | no | Seconds to wait for answer; 0 = no timeout |
| `max_duration` | integer | no | Maximum call duration in seconds after connect. The call is automatically hung up when reached. 0 or omitted = no limit. |
| `codecs` | string[] | no | Codec preference order. Supported: `PCMU`, `PCMA`, `G722`, `opus`. Defaults to engine config. |
| `headers` | object | no | Custom SIP headers to include in the outbound INVITE (e.g. `X-Correlation-ID`). Keys are header names, values are header values. |
| `auth` | object | no for sip, **yes for whatsapp** | Digest auth credentials. Contains `username` (string, optional for whatsapp — defaults to `from` with `+` stripped) and `password` (string). For sip legs, retried on 401/407 challenge. |
| `room_id` | string | no | Room ID to auto-add the leg to once media is ready. The leg joins the room on `early_media` (183+SDP) or `connected` (200 OK), whichever comes first. If the room does not exist, it is automatically created. |
| `webhook_url` | string | no | Per-leg webhook URL. Events for this leg are routed exclusively to this URL instead of global webhooks. |
| `webhook_secret` | string | no | HMAC-SHA256 signing secret for the per-leg webhook. |
| `amd` | object | no | Enable Answering Machine Detection on this outbound call. Disabled by default — omit the field entirely to skip AMD. Include the object to enable; all inner fields are optional and default to sensible values when omitted or zero. See **AMD Parameters** below. |
| `speech_detection` | bool | no | Emit `speaking.started` / `speaking.stopped` events for this leg. Omit to use the server default (`SPEECH_DETECTION_ENABLED` env var, default `false`). |
| `rtt` | bool | no | Offer Real-Time Text (T.140 / RFC 4103) on the outbound INVITE. The peer may accept or ignore the `m=text` section; audio negotiation is unaffected either way. Default: `false`. |

**AMD Parameters** (all optional — `"amd": {}` enables AMD with all defaults):

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `initial_silence_timeout` | integer | 2500 | Max milliseconds of silence before declaring `no_speech`. |
| `greeting_duration` | integer | 1500 | Speech duration threshold (ms). Continuous/cumulative speech exceeding this value classifies the answerer as `machine`. |
| `after_greeting_silence` | integer | 800 | Silence duration (ms) after initial speech to declare `human`. |
| `total_analysis_time` | integer | 5000 | Hard analysis deadline (ms). If no determination is made within this window, the result is `not_sure`. |
| `minimum_word_length` | integer | 100 | Minimum speech burst duration (ms) to count as a word. Shorter bursts are treated as noise. |
| `beep_timeout` | integer | 0 | After detecting `machine`, continue listening up to this many ms for the voicemail beep tone (800–1200 Hz). `0` = beep detection disabled. |

Examples:

```json
"amd": {}                                          // all defaults
"amd": { "beep_timeout": 10000 }                   // defaults + beep detection
"amd": { "greeting_duration": 2000, "beep_timeout": 8000 }  // custom thresholds
```

**Jitter Buffer:** The SIP ingress jitter buffer absorbs variation in RTP packet arrival times. When enabled, packets are reordered by sequence number and released to the decoder at a fixed 20 ms cadence; late packets that miss their slot are replaced with silence. The buffer adds latency equal to its target depth, so it is **off by default** — turn it on only when network jitter is a real concern (PSTN trunks, mobile carriers, satellite links), not for latency-sensitive voice-agent legs.

Configured server-wide:

- `SIP_JITTER_BUFFER_MS` — target delay in ms, applied to every SIP leg. `0` = disabled passthrough (default).
- `SIP_JITTER_BUFFER_MAX_MS` — queue cap in ms (default `300`). Frames beyond this are dropped oldest-first to catch up after a stall.

WebRTC legs are unaffected — pion/webrtc provides its own jitter buffer.

**Response:** `201 Created` — Leg object (initially in `ringing` state)

**Early Media:** When the remote sends a 183 Session Progress response with SDP, the leg automatically transitions to `early_media` state and a `leg.early_media` webhook event is emitted. The RTP media pipeline starts immediately, allowing the leg to be added to a room so other participants can hear the remote's early media (custom ringback, IVR prompts, etc.). When the remote answers (200 OK), the leg transitions to `connected` as normal.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON, bad SIP URI, unknown codec, or unsupported type

---

### WhatsApp Business Calling

VoiceBlender terminates calls to and from WhatsApp's SIP calling service. The signalling layer is SIP over TLS with HTTP Digest auth; the media layer is Opus over ICE + DTLS-SRTP (pion). Meta mandates both and does **not** support `re-INVITE`, so these operations return **409** for WhatsApp legs: `hold`, `unhold`, `transfer`.

**Server prerequisites** (see README env var table):
- `SIP_TLS_PORT=5061`
- `SIP_TLS_CERT` / `SIP_TLS_KEY` pointing at a **CA-signed** certificate (Meta rejects self-signed) whose SAN matches the public FQDN you registered with Meta.
- Operator-side: the SIP endpoint must be registered via Meta's Graph API (`POST /{phone-number-id}/settings`). VoiceBlender does not perform this registration itself.

#### Outbound: POST /v1/legs (type=whatsapp)

Originate a call to a WhatsApp user.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "type": "whatsapp",
  "to": "+15557654321",
  "from": "+15551234567",
  "auth": {
    "password": "meta-issued-digest-password"
  },
  "room_id": "room-123",
  "app_id": "myapp"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `"whatsapp"` |
| `to` | string | yes | Destination phone number (E.164, with or without `+`). |
| `from` | string | yes | Business phone number, E.164 (with or without `+`). Used as the From URI user-part and, by default, as the digest auth username. |
| `auth.password` | string | yes | Meta-issued digest password for the business number. |
| `auth.username` | string | no | Override the digest auth username. Defaults to `from` with `+` stripped, per Meta's spec. |
| `room_id` | string | no | Room ID to auto-add the leg to once connected. Created on the fly if it doesn't exist. |
| `app_id` | string | no | Application identifier for event stream filtering. |

The handler is **asynchronous**: it returns the leg view as soon as PCMedia setup succeeds and the leg is registered. ICE gathering, the INVITE round-trip (including the digest 401/407 retry), and the SDP answer apply happen in the background. Progress is signalled via webhook events:

- `leg.ringing` (`type: "whatsapp_out"`) — fires immediately after the leg is created. The HTTP response is sent at this moment.
- `leg.connected` — fires once Meta returns 200 OK and the SDP answer has been applied.
- `leg.disconnected` — fires if the INVITE fails (`reason: "invite_failed"`), the answer is rejected (`bad_answer`), or the dialog ends (`remote_bye`).

**Response:** `201 Created` — Leg object in `ringing` state with `type: "whatsapp_out"`. Subscribe to `leg.connected` / `leg.disconnected` (webhook or `/v1/vsi`) to track progress.

**Errors (synchronous, before the leg is created):**
- `400` — missing `to` / `from` / `password`.
- `503` — `SIP_TLS_PORT` not configured on this instance.
- `500` — local PCMedia or SDP setup failed.

**Async errors (delivered via `leg.disconnected` event after `201`):**
- `invite_failed` — Meta rejected the INVITE (e.g. 403 / 404 / digest auth failed) or the request timed out.
- `bad_answer` — Meta's 200 OK contained an SDP answer that pion couldn't apply.
- `remote_bye` — call ended normally or Meta hung up.

#### Inbound

INVITEs whose From-URI host is `meta.vc` (or any subdomain, e.g. `wa.meta.vc`) are routed to the WhatsApp handler automatically. The leg is created in `ringing` state with `type: "whatsapp_in"`, a `leg.ringing` webhook event is emitted, and the call remains in this state until `POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer` is invoked. At that point a 200 OK with the pre-gathered SDP answer is sent and the leg transitions to `connected`.

The standard `/answer`, `/mute`, `/deaf`, `/dtmf`, `/play`, `/record`, `/stt`, `/tts`, and `/agent/*` endpoints all apply. The following explicitly return **409 Conflict**:

- `POST /v1/legs/{id}/hold`
- `DELETE /v1/legs/{id}/hold`
- `POST /v1/legs/{id}/transfer`

---

### WebSocket Legs

A **websocket leg** carries PCM audio over a single WebSocket connection. Both directions are supported:

- **Outbound** (`websocket_out`) — VoiceBlender dials a remote WebSocket. Created via `POST /v1/legs` with `type: "websocket"`.
- **Inbound** (`websocket_in`) — an external client connects to VoiceBlender. Created by upgrading `GET /v1/legs/websocket`.

Both directions go straight to `connected` (no ringing/answer flow). Audio is signed 16-bit little-endian PCM, mono, at the configured sample rate (8000/16000/24000/48000 Hz — the room mixer resamples automatically). Hold and DTMF send are not supported on websocket legs. The bidirectional text-message channel is enabled with `rtt: true` (outbound) or `?rtt=true` (inbound) and ties into the same `/v1/legs/{id}/rtt` REST endpoint and `rtt.received` event stream that SIP RTT uses.

#### Wire format

`wire_format=binary` (default): each WebSocket binary frame is one 20ms PCM frame at the configured sample rate. Most efficient; matches the framing used by Deepgram / VAPI-style providers.

`wire_format=json_base64`: PCM frames are wrapped as JSON text frames `{"type":"audio","audio":"<base64-pcm>"}`. Browser-friendly; matches the existing `/v1/rooms/{id}/ws` shape.

Text and control messages always use JSON text frames regardless of wire format:

```
{"type":"text","text":"hello"}            // bidi text (rtt.received event + /rtt REST)
{"type":"ping","event_id":42}             // server-initiated heartbeat
{"type":"pong","event_id":42}             // reply to a server ping
{"type":"hangup"}                          // peer-initiated termination
```

Inbound text triggers a `rtt.received` event; outbound text is sent via `POST /v1/legs/{id}/rtt` or by the WebSocket peer writing the JSON frame above.

#### Outbound: POST /v1/legs (type=websocket)

```json
{
  "type": "websocket",
  "url": "wss://agent.example.com/voice",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "wire_format": "binary",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer abc-123",
    "X-Correlation-ID": "call-456"
  },
  "room_id": "room-789",
  "rtt": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `"websocket"` |
| `url` | string | yes | `ws://` or `wss://` target URL. |
| `sample_rate` | int | no | 8000/16000/24000/48000. Default 16000. |
| `wire_format` | string | no | `binary` (default) or `json_base64`. |
| `sample_format` | string | no | `s16le` (only option in v1). |
| `headers` | object | no | Headers sent on the upgrade request (e.g. `Authorization`, `X-*`, `P-*`). |
| `room_id` | string | no | Room to auto-add the leg to once connected. |
| `rtt` | boolean | no | Enable bidi text channel. Default false. |
| `ring_timeout` | int | no | Seconds to wait for the WS handshake to complete. Default unbounded. |
| `app_id`, `webhook_url`, `webhook_secret`, `max_duration`, `accept_dtmf`, `speech_detection` | — | no | Same semantics as SIP legs. |

**Response:** `201 Created` — Leg object in `ringing` state with `type: "websocket_out"`. The dial completes asynchronously: `leg.connected` (success) or `leg.disconnected` (one of `ring_timeout`, `service_unavailable`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `ws_dial_failed`).

#### Inbound: GET /v1/legs/websocket (HTTP upgrade)

```
GET /v1/legs/websocket?sample_rate=16000&wire_format=binary&room_id=room-789&rtt=true
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: ...
X-Tenant: tenant-a
P-Asserted-Identity: alice@example.com
```

Query parameters: `sample_rate`, `wire_format`, `sample_format`, `room_id`, `app_id`, `rtt`, `webhook_url`, `webhook_secret`. `X-*` and `P-*` request headers (plus `Authorization`) are captured into the leg's `headers` map and exposed on `leg.ringing` (as `sip_headers` for back-compat) and in `LegView.headers`.

Both `leg.ringing` and `leg.connected` are emitted back-to-back on upgrade. `leg.disconnected` fires when the WS closes — reasons: `hangup`, `timeout`, `connection_reset`, `peer_slow`, `ws_error`.

---

### GET /v1/legs

List all active legs.

**Response:** `200 OK` — Array of Leg objects

---

### GET /v1/legs/{id}

Get a single leg.

**Response:** `200 OK` — Leg object

**Errors:** `404` — Leg not found

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/ring

**Asynchronous.** Queue a SIP **180 Ringing** provisional response (no SDP) on a ringing inbound SIP leg. Use this when `SIP_AUTO_RINGING=false` (the default) and you want to indicate alerting before deciding whether to early-media or answer.

The endpoint is **idempotent in spirit** — each call emits another 180 on the wire. Receivers tolerate re-sends, and SIP retransmission rules already handle reliability of provisionals, so multiple `/ring` calls are fine.

> **Auto-ringing default:** Starting with this version, VoiceBlender does **not** send 180 Ringing automatically on inbound INVITE — only 100 Trying. The API caller drives ringing via `/ring`, `/early-media`, or `/answer`. Set `SIP_AUTO_RINGING=true` to restore the legacy "auto-180-on-INVITE" behavior.

**Request:** Empty body

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "ringing" }
```

SIP-level send failures surface as `leg.command_failed` with `command="ring"`.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Not a SIP inbound leg
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg is not in `ringing` state (already early-media, connected, or hung up)

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer

**Asynchronous.** Queue the SIP 200 OK on a ringing or early-media inbound SIP leg. If the leg is in `early_media` state, the existing media pipeline and SDP are reused; if in `ringing` state, a new RTP session and codec negotiation are performed when the goroutine sends the 200 OK. Successful connection is observed via `leg.connected`.

**Request:** Optional body

```json
{
  "speech_detection": true,
  "codec": "PCMA"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `speech_detection` | bool (optional) | Override the server default for `speaking.started` / `speaking.stopped` events on this leg. Omit to use `SPEECH_DETECTION_ENABLED` (default `false`). |
| `codec` | string (optional) | Force a specific codec for the answer SDP. One of `PCMU`, `PCMA`, `G722`, `opus`. Must appear in the remote offer's `offered_codecs` list (see `leg.ringing`). When omitted, the server picks the first codec present in both the remote offer and the engine's supported set. Ignored when the leg is already in `early_media` state — the codec is locked in at 183. |

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "answering" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Not a SIP inbound leg, invalid request body, unknown codec name, or codec not in remote offer
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg is not in `ringing` or `early_media` state

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/early-media

**Asynchronous.** Queue early-media setup on a ringing inbound SIP leg. The goroutine sends SIP 183 Session Progress with SDP, sets up the RTP session and media pipeline, and transitions the leg to `early_media` state. Once in that state, audio can be played to the caller (e.g. custom ringback tones, announcements) and the leg can be added to a room — all before answering the call. Successful transition is observed via `leg.early_media`; setup failures surface as `leg.command_failed` with `command="early_media"`.

**Request:** Optional body

```json
{
  "codec": "opus"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `codec` | string (optional) | Force a specific codec for the 183 Session Progress SDP. One of `PCMU`, `PCMA`, `G722`, `opus`. Must appear in the remote offer's `offered_codecs` list. The codec chosen here is locked in for the subsequent `/answer`. When omitted, the server picks the first codec present in both the remote offer and the engine's supported set. |

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "early_media" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Not a SIP inbound leg, unknown codec name, or codec not in remote offer
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg is not in `ringing` state

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/mute

Mute a leg. A muted leg's audio is excluded from the room mix and speaking events are suppressed. Taps (recording/STT) still receive the muted leg's own audio.

**Request:** Empty body

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "muted" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — Leg not found

---

### DELETE /v1/legs/{id}/mute

Unmute a leg.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "unmuted" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — Leg not found

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/deaf

Deafen a leg. A deaf leg does not receive mixed audio from the room — the participant cannot hear other participants. The leg can still speak (its audio is still mixed for others).

**Request:** Empty body

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "deaf" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — Leg not found

---

### DELETE /v1/legs/{id}/deaf

Undeafen a leg. Restores the participant's ability to hear other participants.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "undeaf" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — Leg not found

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/hold

**Asynchronous.** Queue a re-INVITE with `sendonly` SDP direction. The RTP timeout is paused while held, and a 2-hour auto-hangup timer starts. Successful hold is observed via `leg.hold`; failures surface as `leg.command_failed` with `command="hold"`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "holding" }
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Leg not found
- `400` — Not a SIP leg
- `409` — Hold not supported for this leg type (e.g. WhatsApp), or leg is neither connected nor held

---

### DELETE /v1/legs/{id}/hold

**Asynchronous.** Queue a re-INVITE with `sendrecv` SDP direction. Successful resume is observed via `leg.unhold`; failures surface as `leg.command_failed` with `command="unhold"`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "unholding" }
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Leg not found
- `400` — Not a SIP leg
- `409` — Hold not supported for this leg type (e.g. WhatsApp), or leg is neither connected nor held

---

### DELETE /v1/legs/{id}

**Asynchronous.** Queue a hangup. Sends SIP BYE (or closes the WebRTC connection) on a goroutine and tears down the leg. Final disconnect is observed via `leg.disconnected`.

**Request:** Optional body

```json
{ "reason": "busy" }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `reason` | string (optional) | Disconnect reason. Honored only for **unanswered SIP inbound legs** (state `ringing` or `early_media`); on connected legs the body is ignored and the leg is hung up with the legacy `api_hangup` reason. The reason value flows through to `leg.disconnected`'s `cdr.reason` and selects the SIP final response sent to the caller. |

#### Reason → SIP final response (unanswered inbound only)

| `reason` | SIP response |
|---|---|
| `busy` | 486 Busy Here |
| `declined` / `rejected` | 603 Decline |
| `unavailable` | 480 Temporarily Unavailable |
| `not_found` | 404 Not Found |
| `forbidden` | 403 Forbidden |
| `server_error` | 500 Server Internal Error |

Without a body, behavior is unchanged: BYE on connected legs (`cdr.reason: "api_hangup"`), or dialog cancel on unanswered inbound legs (`cdr.reason: "caller_cancel"`).

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "hanging_up" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Unknown `reason` value
- `404` — Leg not found

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/transfer

Transfer a SIP leg to a third party using SIP REFER (RFC 3515). Supports both **blind** and **attended** flavours. The leg must be in `connected` state.

- **Blind transfer** — `{"target": "sip:..."}`. We send REFER inside the leg's existing dialog; the peer dials the target. Progress is reported back to us via NOTIFY sipfrag and surfaces as `leg.transfer_progress` events. On terminal 2xx (`leg.transfer_completed`) the leg is hung up automatically.
- **Attended transfer** — `{"target": "sip:...", "replaces_leg_id": "<uuid>"}`. The named leg must already be in `connected` state. Its dialog identity is embedded as a `Replaces` parameter on the Refer-To URI (RFC 3891) so the peer's INVITE replaces that dialog instead of creating a fresh one. Both legs are hung up on completion.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "target": "sip:bob@example.com",
  "replaces_leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `target` | string | yes | SIP URI of the third party |
| `replaces_leg_id` | string | no | Existing connected SIP leg whose dialog should be replaced (attended transfer). Omit for blind. |

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

```json
{ "status": "transfer_initiated" }
```

The REST call returns immediately after validating the request. The REFER is sent in the background and its outcome (accepted, rejected, or network error) surfaces on the event bus.

**Events emitted:** `leg.transfer_initiated` when the peer's 202 Accepted arrives, then `leg.transfer_progress` per NOTIFY sipfrag, then either `leg.transfer_completed` or `leg.transfer_failed`. If the peer rejects the REFER outright (e.g. 603 Decline), only `leg.transfer_failed` fires.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Missing or invalid `target` (including URIs without a host such as `sip:`)
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg not connected, not a SIP leg, or `replaces_leg_id` is not a connected SIP leg

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/dtmf

Send DTMF digits on a leg (RFC 4733 telephone-event).

**Request:**

```json
{ "digits": "123#" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `digits` | string | yes | Digits to send (`0-9`, `*`, `#`) |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "sent" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON or empty digits
- `404` — Leg not found
- `500` — DTMF writer unavailable

---

### DTMF broadcast

When a leg in a room receives DTMF (e.g. the SIP peer presses a key), VoiceBlender forwards
that digit to every other leg in the same room that has DTMF reception enabled. The originating
leg always emits its `dtmf.received` event regardless.

WebRTC legs are skipped as recipients (DTMF send over WebRTC is not yet implemented). The sending
leg is excluded from the broadcast.

DTMF reception is **on by default** for every leg. To control it:

- At originate: set `accept_dtmf: false` in the `POST /v1/legs` body.
- When adding to a room: set `accept_dtmf: false` in the `POST /v1/rooms/{id}/legs` body.
- At runtime: `POST /v1/legs/{id}/dtmf/reject` (disable) and `POST /v1/legs/{id}/dtmf/accept` (re-enable).

The current state is exposed as `accept_dtmf` on the leg view returned by `GET /v1/legs/{id}`.

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/dtmf/accept

Allow this leg to receive DTMF digits forwarded from other legs in the same room. Default state for new legs.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "dtmf_accepting" }
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Leg not found

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/dtmf/reject

Block this leg from receiving DTMF digits forwarded from other legs in the same room. The leg's own DTMF (received from its far end) still emits a `dtmf.received` event.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "dtmf_rejecting" }
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/abc-123/dtmf/reject
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Leg not found

---

### Real-Time Text (RTT, ITU-T T.140 / RFC 4103)

VoiceBlender can negotiate an `m=text` media line alongside `m=audio` on SIP legs and exchange UTF-8 text in real time using the RFC 4103 RTP payload with RFC 2198 redundancy. Useful for accessibility (deaf / hard-of-hearing callers) and totally-conversational compliance scenarios.

- **Inbound calls** automatically accept any `m=text` section the caller offers — no configuration needed.
- **Outbound calls** offer RTT only when the originate request sets `"rtt": true` (see `POST /v1/legs`). Peers that don't speak RFC 4103 simply ignore or reject the section, and audio still negotiates normally.

WebRTC legs do not currently bridge RTT (browsers use RFC 8865 over data channels rather than RFC 4103 over RTP).

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/rtt

Send a chunk of UTF-8 text on the leg's RTT stream. Requires that the SDP exchange agreed on `m=text`.

**Request:**

```json
{ "text": "hello\n" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | yes | UTF-8 text. May include T.140 control codes such as backspace (``) or CR/LF. |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "sent" }
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/abc-123/rtt \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"hello"}'
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON or empty text
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — RTT was not negotiated for this leg (peer didn't include `m=text`, or `RTT_ENABLED=false`)
- `500` — Send failed

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/rtt/accept

Allow this leg to receive RTT text broadcast from other legs in the same room and to emit `rtt.received` events. Default for new legs.

**Response:** `200 OK { "status": "rtt_accepting" }`

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/rtt/reject

Block this leg from receiving RTT text broadcast from other legs and suppress `rtt.received` events for it.

**Response:** `200 OK { "status": "rtt_rejecting" }`

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/play

  "provider": "azure",
  "volume": 0
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | yes | Text to synthesize |
| `voice` | string | yes | Provider-specific voice identifier. ElevenLabs: voice name or ID. AWS Polly: voice ID (e.g. `Joanna`, `Matthew`). Google Cloud: voice name — either full format (e.g. `en-US-Neural2-F`) or short name for Gemini models (e.g. `Achernar`, `Kore`). Deepgram: model name (e.g. `aura-2-asteria-en`). Azure: voice name (e.g. `en-US-JennyNeural`, `pl-PL-MarekNeural`). |
| `provider` | string | no | TTS provider: `"elevenlabs"` (default), `"aws"`, `"google"`, `"deepgram"`, or `"azure"` |
| `model_id` | string | no | Provider-specific model/engine. ElevenLabs: model ID. AWS Polly: engine (`standard`, `neural`, `long-form`, `generative`; default `neural`). Google Cloud: model name (e.g. `gemini-2.5-pro-tts`, `chirp3-hd`). Not used for Deepgram or Azure (voice selects the model). |
| `language` | string | no | Language code (e.g. `"en-US"`, `"pl-pl"`). Required for Google Gemini TTS voices that use short names (e.g. `Achernar`). Auto-extracted from full voice names like `en-US-Neural2-F` or `en-US-JennyNeural`. |

Azure: subscription key override (falls back to `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` env var). |

**Providers:**
- `elevenlabs` — ElevenLabs streaming TTS API (default). Requires an API key.
- `aws` — Amazon Polly. Uses the default AWS credential chain (env vars, IAM role, shared credentials file). No API key required unless overriding credentials per-request.
- `google` — Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. Uses Application Default Credentials (ADC). No API key required unless overriding per-request. Supports all voice types: Standard, WaveNet, Neural2, Studio, Chirp 3 HD, and Gemini TTS. For Gemini models (e.g. `gemini-2.5-pro-tts`), set `model_id` and `language` explicitly; use `prompt` for style instructions.
- `deepgram` — Deepgram TTS API. Requires an API key. The `voice` field selects the model (e.g. `aura-2-asteria-en`).
- `azure` — Azure Cognitive Speech Services. Requires a subscription key (`AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`). Voice names follow the `{lang}-{region}-{Name}` pattern (e.g. `en-US-JennyNeural`). Language is auto-extracted from the voice name.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "tts_id": "tts-a1b2c3d4", "status": "playing" }
```

Events `tts.started` and `tts.finished` are emitted.

**Caching:** When `TTS_CACHE_ENABLED=true`, identical requests (same text, voice, model, language, and prompt) are served from the disk cache stored in `TTS_CACHE_DIR`, skipping the external provider call. The cache persists across restarts; to clear it, delete the files in that directory. Set `TTS_CACHE_INCLUDE_API_KEY=true` to scope the cache per API key (needed when different keys access different voice clones).

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON, missing text/voice, volume out of range
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg has no audio writer
- `503` — No API key provided for the selected provider

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/record

Start recording a leg to a WAV file.

For SIP legs, recording is **stereo** (16-bit PCM at the codec's native sample rate):
- **Left channel** — incoming audio (what the remote party says)
- **Right channel** — outgoing audio (what we send, including agent TTS)

For legs in a room, recording is stereo at 16kHz:
- **Left channel** — participant's incoming audio (before mix)
- **Right channel** — mixed-minus-self (what the participant hears)

**Request:**

```json
{
  "storage": "s3",
  "s3_bucket": "my-recordings",
  "s3_region": "eu-west-1",
  "s3_endpoint": "https://s3.example.com",
  "s3_prefix": "calls/",
  "s3_access_key": "AKIA...",
  "s3_secret_key": "wJalr..."
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `storage` | string | no | `"file"` (default) — local disk, `"s3"` — upload to S3 after recording stops |
| `s3_bucket` | string | no | S3 bucket name. Overrides `S3_BUCKET` env var. Required if env var is not set. |
| `s3_region` | string | no | AWS region. Overrides `S3_REGION` env var. Default `us-east-1`. |
| `s3_endpoint` | string | no | Custom S3 endpoint (MinIO, etc.). Overrides `S3_ENDPOINT` env var. |
| `s3_prefix` | string | no | Key prefix (e.g. `recordings/`). Overrides `S3_PREFIX` env var. |
| `s3_access_key` | string | no | AWS access key ID. Overrides default credential chain. |
| `s3_secret_key` | string | no | AWS secret access key. Must be set together with `s3_access_key`. |

When `s3_bucket` is provided, a per-request S3 backend is created using the supplied config. Otherwise the server-level S3 backend (from env vars) is used.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "status": "recording",
  "file": "/tmp/recordings/20260301_110500_a1b2c3d4.wav"
}
```

Recording runs asynchronously. Events `recording.started` and `recording.finished` are emitted. When `storage=s3`, the `file` field in the stop response and the `recording.finished` event will contain an `s3://bucket/key` URI.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid storage type, S3 not configured, or invalid S3 credentials
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg has no audio reader
- `500` — Failed to create recording file

---

### DELETE /v1/legs/{id}/record

Stop recording a leg.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "status": "stopped",
  "file": "/tmp/recordings/20260301_110500_a1b2c3d4.wav"
}
```

**Errors:** `404` — No recording in progress

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/record/pause

Pause the active recording for a leg. While paused, the WAV continues to advance in real time but the audio is replaced with silence, so the file preserves the full session duration with a clearly silent gap where sensitive data was excluded (e.g. credit-card capture, PII exchange). Both sides of a stereo recording are silenced together.

Idempotent: calling while already paused returns `status: already_paused`.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{"status": "paused"}
```

or, if already paused:

```json
{"status": "already_paused"}
```

Emits a `recording.paused` event.

**Errors:** `404` — No recording in progress

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/record/resume

Resume a previously paused leg recording. Idempotent: calling while not paused returns `status: not_paused`.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{"status": "resumed"}
```

Emits a `recording.resumed` event.

**Errors:** `404` — No recording in progress

**Example — pause around sensitive data:**

```bash
# Start recording
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/$LEG_ID/record

# ... agent collects call details ...

# Pause before asking for credit card
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/$LEG_ID/record/pause

# ... agent collects card number + CVV ...

# Resume for the rest of the call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/$LEG_ID/record/resume

# Stop when done
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/$LEG_ID/record
```

---

- `deepgram` — Deepgram real-time STT via WebSocket. Uses Nova-3 model. Audio is sent as raw binary PCM frames.
- `azure` — Azure Cognitive Speech Services real-time STT via WebSocket. Requires a subscription key (`AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`) and region (`AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`). Language defaults to `"en-US"`.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "stt_started", "leg_id": "550e8400-..." }
```

Transcripts are delivered via `stt.text` webhook events.

```json
{ "status": "agent_stopped" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — No agent attached to this leg

---

## Rooms

A **room** is a multi-party audio conference. Legs added to a room hear mixed audio from all other participants (mixed-minus-self).

### Room Object

```json
{
  "id": "room-123",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "participants": [
    { "id": "leg-uuid", "type": "sip_inbound", "state": "connected", "room_id": "room-123" }
  ]
}
```

---

### POST /v1/rooms

Create a room.

**Request:**

```json
{ "id": "my-custom-room-id", "sample_rate": 48000 }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | no | Custom room ID. Auto-generated UUID if omitted. |
| `sample_rate` | integer | no | Mixer sample rate in Hz. Allowed values: `8000`, `16000`, `48000`. Default: `16000`. Higher rates preserve more audio fidelity but use proportionally more CPU and memory. |

---

### GET /v1/rooms

List all rooms with their participants.

**Response:** `200 OK` — Array of Room objects

---

### GET /v1/rooms/{id}

Get a room with its participants.

**Response:** `200 OK` — Room object

**Errors:** `404` — Room not found

---

### DELETE /v1/rooms/{id}

Delete a room. All participants are hung up.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "deleted" }
```

**Errors:** `404` — Room not found

---

### POST /v1/rooms/{id}/legs

Add a leg to a room, or move it from another room. The leg must be in `connected` or `early_media` state. If the leg is a ringing inbound SIP leg, it is automatically answered before being added. If the room does not exist, it is automatically created.

If the leg is already in a different room, it is atomically moved — detached from the source mixer and immediately added to the target mixer with minimal audio gap. If the target room does not exist, it is auto-created.

**Request:**

```json
{ "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" }
```

Join already muted / deaf:

```json
{
  "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "mute": true,
  "deaf": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `leg_id` | string | yes | ID of the leg to add |
| `mute` | bool | no | Apply this mute state to the leg atomically before it joins the mixer — prevents the race where one frame of un-muted audio leaks into the mix between add and `/mute`. Omit to leave current state untouched (useful on move). |
| `deaf` | bool | no | Apply this deaf state to the leg atomically before it joins the mixer. Omit to leave current state untouched. |

**Response (added):** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "added" }
```

**Response (moved from another room):** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "moved", "from": "room-123", "to": "room-456" }
```

Events `leg.left_room` and `leg.joined_room` are emitted on move.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON, leg not found, leg not connected, or leg already in this room

---

### DELETE /v1/rooms/{id}/legs/{legID}

Remove a leg from a room (without hanging it up).

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "removed" }
```

**Errors:** `400` — Room or leg not found

## Room Bridges

A **bridge** joins two rooms' mixers so audio flows between them, without
merging their participant sets. Both rooms must already exist and use the
**same sample rate** (no resampling is performed on the bridge). Mixed-minus-self
in each mixer prevents the other room's audio from echoing back across the
bridge.

`direction` is always **relative to the room in the request path** (`{id}`):

| `direction` | Path room sends | Path room receives |
|---|---|---|
| `bidirectional` (default) | yes | yes |
| `send` | yes | no |
| `receive` | no | yes |
| `none` | no | no |

A room may hold several bridges (e.g. A↔B and A↔C). The mixer of a bridged
room is kept running even when it has no legs, so a one-way `receive`/`send`
bridge into an otherwise empty room works (e.g. a recorder/agent room).

> **Cycle warning:** bridging rooms into a cycle (A→B→C→A) with feedback-enabled
> directions causes audio feedback. Use one-way directions to break loops.

> **Audio only:** a bridge relays mixed PCM audio between the two rooms. It does
> **not** relay DTMF (RFC 4733 telephone-events) or RTT (T.140) — those are
> broadcast only among the legs within a single room, so digits/text entered in
> one bridged room are not delivered to participants of the other.

The `room.bridged` / `room.bridge_updated` / `room.unbridged` webhook events
report `room_a_id` (the room the bridge was created from) and `room_b_id`, and
their `direction` is **canonical relative to `room_a_id`** (`bidirectional`,
`a_to_b`, `b_to_a`, or `none`) — independent of which room you call the REST
endpoint from.

### POST /v1/rooms/{id}/bridges

Bridge the room in the path to another room.

**Request:**

```json
{ "room_id": "room-b", "direction": "bidirectional" }

```

**Response:** `201 Created`

```json
{ "id": "b1f2…", "room_id": "room-b", "direction": "bidirectional", "sample_rate": 16000 }
```

**Errors:** `400` — invalid JSON, self-bridge, sample-rate mismatch, or invalid
direction · `404` — path room or `room_id` not found · `409` — a bridge between
these rooms already exists

### GET /v1/rooms/{id}/bridges

Synthesize speech and play it into a room.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "text": "Attention please.",
  "voice": "Rachel",
  "provider": "elevenlabs",

  "volume": 0
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | yes | Text to synthesize |
| `voice` | string | yes | Provider-specific voice identifier. ElevenLabs: voice name or ID. AWS Polly: voice ID (e.g. `Joanna`, `Matthew`).

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "tts_id": "tts-a1b2c3d4", "status": "playing" }
```

Events `tts.started` and `tts.finished` are emitted.

**Caching:** When `TTS_CACHE_ENABLED=true`, identical requests (same text, voice, model, language, and prompt) are served from the disk cache stored in `TTS_CACHE_DIR`, skipping the external provider call. The cache persists across restarts; to clear it, delete the files in that directory. Set `TTS_CACHE_INCLUDE_API_KEY=true` to scope the cache per API key (needed when different keys access different voice clones).

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON, missing text/voice, volume out of range
- `404` — Room not found
- `409` — Room has no participants
- `503` — No API key provided for the selected provider

### POST /v1/rooms/{id}/record

Start recording the full room mix to a WAV file (16-bit, mono, at the room's configured sample rate).

**Request:**

```json
{
  "storage": "s3",
  "multi_channel": true,
  "s3_bucket": "my-recordings",
  "s3_region": "eu-west-1",
  "s3_access_key": "AKIA...",
  "s3_secret_key": "wJalr..."
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `storage` | string | no | `"file"` (default) — local disk, `"s3"` — upload to S3 after recording stops |
| `multi_channel` | boolean | no | When `true`, produce a single multi-channel WAV file with one track per participant (time-aligned with silence padding), in addition to the full mix. Default `false`. |
| `s3_bucket` | string | no | S3 bucket name. Overrides `S3_BUCKET` env var. Required if env var is not set. |
| `s3_region` | string | no | AWS region. Overrides `S3_REGION` env var. Default `us-east-1`. |
| `s3_endpoint` | string | no | Custom S3 endpoint (MinIO, etc.). Overrides `S3_ENDPOINT` env var. |
| `s3_prefix` | string | no | Key prefix (e.g. `recordings/`). Overrides `S3_PREFIX` env var. |
| `s3_access_key` | string | no | AWS access key ID. Overrides default credential chain. |
| `s3_secret_key` | string | no | AWS secret access key. Must be set together with `s3_access_key`. |

When `s3_bucket` is provided, a per-request S3 backend is created. Otherwise the server-level S3 backend (from env vars) is used.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "status": "recording",
  "file": "/tmp/recordings/20260301_110500_a1b2c3d4.wav"
}
```

When `storage=s3`, the `file` field in the stop response and the `recording.finished` event will contain an `s3://bucket/key` URI.

#### Multi-Channel Recording

When `multi_channel: true` is set, a single multi-channel WAV file is produced alongside the full mix. Each participant gets their own channel (track) within this file, with silence padding so all tracks are time-aligned to the recording start. Participants that join mid-recording get a new channel; participants that leave have silence written for the remainder.

This gives you one file ready for post-production — each speaker on a clean isolated channel for independent editing, noise reduction, and level adjustment.

The per-participant audio capture uses a dedicated mixer tap that is independent of STT/agent taps, so multi-channel recording and STT can run simultaneously without conflict.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid storage type, S3 not configured, or invalid S3 credentials
- `404` — Room not found
- `409` — Room has no participants
- `500` — Failed to create recording file

---

### POST /v1/rooms/{id}/record/pause

Pause the active room recording. The room-mix WAV is silenced. If `multi_channel: true` was used when starting the recording, every per-participant track is paused too — including tracks for participants that join the room **while the recording is paused**, so sensitive data can't leak in via a new leg.

Idempotent: returns `status: already_paused` if already paused.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{"status": "paused"}
```

Emits a `recording.paused` event.

**Errors:** `404` — No recording in progress

---

Resume a previously paused room recording. Resumes every per-participant track if multi-channel recording is active. Idempotent: returns `status: not_paused` if not paused.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{"status": "resumed"}
```

Emits a `recording.resumed` event.

**Errors:** `404` — No recording in progress

}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

### GET /v1/rooms/{id}/ws

Upgrade to a WebSocket connection and join the room as a bidirectional audio participant. The client sends and receives 16kHz 16-bit signed little-endian PCM audio (mono), base64-encoded in JSON text frames. Each audio frame is 640 bytes (20ms).

This endpoint shares its WebSocket transport (`internal/wsmedia`) and wire protocol with `GET /v1/legs/websocket` when the leg endpoint is invoked with `wire_format=json_base64`. The two endpoints differ only in semantics: this one attaches a raw mixer participant (no leg lifecycle, no `/v1/legs/{id}/...` operations, no leg events), while `/v1/legs/websocket` creates a real leg.

**Upgrade:** Standard HTTP → WebSocket upgrade. No request body.

**Errors:**
- `404` — Room not found (returned before upgrade)

#### Message Format

**Server → Client (on connect):**

```json
{"type": "connected", "participant_id": "ws-a1b2c3d4", "sample_rate": 16000, "format": "pcm_s16le"}
```

**Client → Server (send audio):**

```json
{"audio": "<base64-encoded-16kHz-16bit-PCM>"}
```

**Server → Client (receive mixed audio):**

```json
{"audio": "<base64-encoded-16kHz-16bit-PCM>"}
```

**Server → Client (keepalive ping):**

```json
{"type": "ping", "event_id": 1}
```

**Client → Server (keepalive pong):**

```json
{"type": "pong", "event_id": 1}
```

**Client → Server (disconnect):**

```json
{"type": "stop"}
```

The server sends application-level pings every 30 seconds. The connection is also a full mixer participant — it receives mixed-minus-self audio from all other participants in the room.

---

### GET /v1/vsi (VSI)

Upgrade to a WebSocket connection and receive all events in real-time as JSON text frames. The JSON shape is identical to webhook payloads (same `Event.MarshalJSON` format).

The full machine-readable contract for the VSI WebSocket — every command, every event, every lifecycle frame — lives in [`asyncapi.yaml`](./asyncapi.yaml) (AsyncAPI 3.0). The tables below are a quick reference; the YAML is authoritative and is generated from `internal/api/vsi_meta.go` via `make asyncapi`.

**Upgrade:** Standard HTTP → WebSocket upgrade. No request body.

**Query Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `app_id` | string (regex) | If set, only events whose `app_id` matches the regex are forwarded. Omit to receive all events. |

Set `app_id` on legs via `POST /v1/legs` body or `X-App-ID` SIP header on inbound calls. Set on rooms via `POST /v1/rooms` body. Auto-created rooms inherit `app_id` from the originating leg.

**Example with filter:**

```bash
websocat "ws://localhost:8080/v1/vsi?app_id=^billing$"
```

#### Message Format

**Server → Client (on connect):**

```json
{"type": "connected"}
```

**Server → Client (event):**

```json
{"type": "leg.connected", "timestamp": "2026-04-15T12:00:00Z", "instance_id": "i-abc", "leg_id": "550e8400-...", "leg_type": "sip_outbound"}
```

Events use the same flattened JSON envelope as webhook POSTs. Clients already parsing webhook payloads can reuse the same deserializer.

**Server → Client (keepalive ping):**

```json
{"type": "ping", "event_id": 1}
```

**Client → Server (keepalive pong):**

```json
{"type": "pong"}
```

**Client → Server (disconnect):**

```json
{"type": "stop"}
```

**Client → Server (commands):**

The WebSocket accepts bidirectional commands using the same naming as the REST API. All commands support an optional `request_id` echoed back in the response.

```json
// Client sends:
{"type": "mute_leg", "request_id": "req-1", "payload": {"id": "abc-123"}}

// Server responds (success):
{"type": "mute_leg.result", "request_id": "req-1", "data": {"status": "muted"}}

// Server responds (error):
{"type": "error", "request_id": "req-1", "data": {"code": 404, "message": "leg not found"}}
```

#### Available commands

| Command | Payload | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|

The server sends application-level pings every 30 seconds. If a client reads too slowly, events are buffered per-connection. When the buffer is full, **new events are dropped** and the server sends a notification before the next successfully delivered event:

```json
{"type": "events_dropped", "count": 12}
```

On receiving this, the client should resync state via REST (e.g. `GET /v1/legs`, `GET /v1/rooms`) since it may have missed transitions.

The per-connection buffer size defaults to **256 events** and is configurable via the `VSI_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` environment variable (clamped to `[16, 1_000_000]`). Operators see a warn log (`vsi: event buffer full, dropping event`) on the first drop in a burst and on each 10× escalation, so sustained drops are visible without flooding the log.

**Tuning the buffer.** Larger buffers absorb longer back-pressure spikes but trade off:
- **Memory:** ~1 KB per slot at typical event sizes; e.g. 256 → ~256 KB per client, 10_000 → ~10 MB per client. Multiply by your concurrent VSI client count.
- **Latency:** when a slow client catches up, every event in the buffer is delivered before any new one — a 10_000-deep buffer means the client may see events that are tens of seconds old. The 30s ping is unaffected (sent on a separate goroutine), but the application's view of "now" can lag.
- **Failure radius:** with a small buffer you drop fast and resync fast; with a large buffer the client stays "almost caught up" for longer before giving up.

The default of 256 is sized for healthy clients on a normal event stream (one inbound call generates ~10 events). Increase only when you have a legitimate slow-consumer scenario you can't fix at the client.

**Example:**

```bash
websocat ws://localhost:8080/v1/vsi
```

## WebRTC

### POST /v1/webrtc/offer

Establish a WebRTC leg via SDP offer/answer exchange. The browser sends an SDP offer and receives an SDP answer plus a leg ID. The answer is returned immediately without waiting for ICE gathering to complete — use the trickle ICE endpoints below to exchange candidates incrementally.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "sdp": "v=0\r\no=- 4611731400430051336 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1\r\n..."
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "sdp": "v=0\r\no=- 4611731400430051336 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1\r\n..."
}
```

The returned `leg_id` can be used with all `/v1/legs` and `/v1/rooms` endpoints.

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON or invalid SDP offer
- `500` — Peer connection, track creation, or answer generation failed

**Audio codec:** PCMU (G.711 u-law), 8kHz, mono.

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/amd

Start answering machine detection on an already-connected SIP leg. This is an alternative to including the `amd` object in `POST /v1/legs` — use this endpoint when AMD was not enabled at call creation time.

All AMD parameters are optional. An empty request body `{}` enables AMD with all defaults. See **AMD Parameters** above for the full parameter reference.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "beep_timeout": 10000
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "status": "started"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid AMD params or leg is not a SIP leg
- `404` — Leg not found
- `409` — Leg is not in `connected` state (AMD can only start on answered calls)

---

### POST /v1/legs/{id}/ice-candidates

Send a remote ICE candidate to the server for a WebRTC leg (trickle ICE).

**Request:**

```json
{
  "candidate": "candidate:842163049 1 udp 1677729535 ...",
  "sdpMid": "0",
  "sdpMLineIndex": 0
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `candidate` | string | yes | ICE candidate string |
| `sdpMid` | string | no | Media stream ID |
| `sdpMLineIndex` | integer | no | Media description index |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "status": "added" }
```

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid JSON or leg is not a WebRTC leg
- `404` — Leg not found
- `500` — Failed to add ICE candidate

---

### GET /v1/legs/{id}/ice-candidates

Retrieve server-side ICE candidates gathered since the last call (trickle ICE). Poll this endpoint until `done` is `true` and `candidates` is empty.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    { "candidate": "candidate:...", "sdpMid": "0", "sdpMLineIndex": 0 }
  ],
  "done": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `candidates` | array | ICE candidates gathered since last poll |
| `done` | boolean | `true` when ICE gathering is complete |

**Errors:**
- `400` — Leg is not a WebRTC leg
- `404` — Leg not found

---

### WebRTC over VSI

The same offer/answer/trickle-ICE flow is also available over the `/v1/vsi` WebSocket — useful when a client is already connected to receive events and wants to avoid an extra HTTP round trip per ICE candidate. Three commands mirror the REST endpoints:

| Command | Payload | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `webrtc_offer` | `{"sdp":"..."}` | `{"leg_id":"...","sdp":"..."}` |
| `webrtc_add_candidate` | `{"id":"...","candidate":{...}}` | `{"status":"added"}` |
| `webrtc_get_candidates` | `{"id":"..."}` | `{"candidates":[...],"done":true}` |

**Example exchange:**

```json
// Client → server
{"type":"webrtc_offer","request_id":"r1","payload":{"sdp":"v=0\r\no=- ..."}}

// Server → client
{"type":"webrtc_offer.result","request_id":"r1","data":{"leg_id":"550e8400-...","sdp":"v=0\r\no=- ..."}}

// Client → server (one frame per browser-side candidate)
{"type":"webrtc_add_candidate","request_id":"r2","payload":{"id":"550e8400-...","candidate":{"candidate":"candidate:...","sdpMid":"0","sdpMLineIndex":0}}}

// Server → client
{"type":"webrtc_add_candidate.result","request_id":"r2","data":{"status":"added"}}

// Client polls until done=true
{"type":"webrtc_get_candidates","request_id":"r3","payload":{"id":"550e8400-..."}}
{"type":"webrtc_get_candidates.result","request_id":"r3","data":{"candidates":[{"candidate":"candidate:...","sdpMid":"0","sdpMLineIndex":0}],"done":false}}
```

The returned `leg_id` is interchangeable with REST: subsequent `mute_leg`, `add_leg_to_room`, `delete_leg`, etc. all accept it. Errors follow the standard VSI error envelope (`{"type":"error","request_id":"...","data":{"code":...,"message":"..."}}`).

## Webhooks

Webhooks deliver real-time event notifications via HTTP POST. There are three ways to configure webhooks:

1. **Global webhook** — set via `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variables. Receives all events that don't have a more specific webhook.
2. **Per-leg webhook** — set via `webhook_url` / `webhook_secret` in the create leg request body, or via `X-Webhook-URL` / `X-Webhook-Secret` SIP headers on inbound calls.
3. **Per-room webhook** — set via `webhook_url` / `webhook_secret` in the create room request body.

### Routing Priority

When an event is emitted, webhooks are resolved in this order (highest to lowest):

1. **Leg's webhook** — used when the event carries a `leg_id` and that leg has a `webhook_url` set.
2. **Room's webhook** — used when the event has a `room_id` (but no matching leg webhook) and that room has a `webhook_url` set.
3. **Global webhook** — used for all other events (configured via `WEBHOOK_URL` env var).

For events that carry both `leg_id` and `room_id` (e.g. `speaking.started`, `stt.text`), the leg's webhook takes precedence over the room's webhook.

For inbound SIP calls, the `X-Webhook-URL` and `X-Webhook-Secret` SIP headers in the INVITE can set per-leg webhooks on a call-by-call basis, overriding the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

---

## Webhook Events

Events are delivered as HTTP POST requests to registered webhook URLs.

### Delivery

- **Method:** POST
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Retries:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s)
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds per attempt
- **Worker pool:** 10 concurrent delivery goroutines
- **Queue capacity:** 1000 events (dropped if full)

### Signature Verification

When a `secret` is configured, a `X-Signature-256` header is included:

```
X-Signature-256: sha256=<hex-encoded-hmac-sha256>
```

The signature is computed over the raw JSON request body using HMAC-SHA256 with the webhook secret as the key.

### Event Envelope

Event data fields are flattened into the top-level JSON object alongside the envelope fields — there is no `"data"` wrapper.

```json
{
  "type": "leg.ringing",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T11:05:00.123Z",
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "leg_type": "sip_inbound",
  "from": "sip:alice@example.com",
  "to": "sip:bob@example.com",
  "offered_codecs": [
    { "name": "opus", "payload_type": 111, "clock_rate": 48000, "priority": 1 },
    { "name": "PCMU", "payload_type": 0,   "clock_rate": 8000,  "priority": 2 },
    { "name": "PCMA", "payload_type": 8,   "clock_rate": 8000,  "priority": 3 }
  ]
}
```

**`offered_codecs`** (inbound SIP only) lists the audio codecs from the remote INVITE's offer SDP, in offer order. `priority` is 1-based and matches the order — lower value = higher priority. Use any `name` from this list as the `codec` field on `POST /v1/legs/{id}/early-media` or `POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer` to force that codec for the answer SDP.

All events include `instance_id` alongside the event-specific fields.

### Event Types

All event data uses typed structs with consistent field names. Events scoped to a leg include `leg_id`, events scoped to a room include `room_id`, and events that can target either include both (with the unused field omitted).

| Event | Description | Data Fields |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `leg.ringing` | SIP or WhatsApp call ringing | `leg_id`, `leg_type` (`sip_inbound`/`sip_outbound`/`whatsapp_in`), `from`, `to` (inbound); `leg_id`, `leg_type`, `uri`, `from` (outbound). `sip_headers` included when `X-*` headers are present. `offered_codecs` included on inbound SIP — array of `{name, payload_type, clock_rate, priority}` from the remote SDP offer, in priority order. |
| `leg.early_media` | Outbound leg received 183 Session Progress with SDP; media pipeline active | `leg_id`, `leg_type` |
| `leg.connected` | Leg answered/connected | `leg_id`, `leg_type` |
| `leg.disconnected` | Leg hung up | `leg_id`, `cdr`, `quality` (see CDR-style structure below) |
| `leg.joined_room` | Leg added to room | `leg_id`, `room_id` |
| `leg.left_room` | Leg removed from room | `leg_id`, `room_id` |

| `leg.unhold` | Leg taken off hold (local or remote) | `leg_id`, `leg_type` |
| `leg.command_failed` | An asynchronous leg command failed after the HTTP 202 was returned | `leg_id`, `command` (e.g. `ring`, `early_media`, `hold`, `unhold`, `add_to_room`), `error` |
| `leg.transfer_initiated` | We sent a SIP REFER for this leg | `leg_id`, `kind` (`blind`/`attended`), `target`, `replaces_leg_id` |
| `leg.transfer_requested` | A peer sent us a SIP REFER targeting this leg | `leg_id`, `kind`, `target`, `replaces_call_id`, `declined` |
| `leg.transfer_progress` | NOTIFY sipfrag for an in-flight transfer | `leg_id`, `status_code`, `reason` |
| `leg.transfer_completed` | Transfer reached terminal 2xx; leg is hung up | `leg_id`, `status_code`, `reason` |
| `leg.transfer_failed` | Transfer ended in non-2xx or local error | `leg_id`, `status_code`, `reason`, `error` |
| `dtmf.received` | DTMF digit received | `leg_id`, `digit`, `seq` |
| `rtt.received` | RTT (T.140 / RFC 4103) text chunk received | `leg_id`, `text`, `seq`, `loss_marker` |
| `speaking.started` | Participant started speaking | `leg_id`, `room_id` (if in a room) |
| `speaking.stopped` | Participant stopped speaking | `leg_id`, `room_id` (if in a room) |

> **Note:** `speaking.started` and `speaking.stopped` events fire for any connected leg, whether standalone or in a room. When the leg is in a room, the event includes `room_id`; standalone legs omit it.
>
> **Opt-in:** Speech detection is **disabled by default**. Enable it globally by setting `SPEECH_DETECTION_ENABLED=true`, or per call by setting `"speech_detection": true` on `POST /v1/legs` (outbound) or `POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer` (inbound). Per-call values override the global default.

| `playback.started` | Playback began | `leg_id` or `room_id`, `playback_id` |
| `playback.finished` | Playback ended | `leg_id` or `room_id`, `playback_id` |

| `recording.paused` | Recording paused (audio replaced with silence) | `leg_id` or `room_id` |
| `recording.resumed` | Recording resumed from a paused state | `leg_id` or `room_id` |
| `stt.text` | Speech-to-text transcript | `leg_id`, `room_id` (if room STT), `text`, `is_final` |
| `agent.connected` | Agent connected to provider | `leg_id` or `room_id`, `conversation_id` |
| `agent.disconnected` | Agent session ended | `leg_id` or `room_id` |

| `amd.beep` | Voicemail beep tone detected | `leg_id`, `beep_ms` |

#### `amd.result` — Answering Machine Detection

Emitted when AMD analysis completes on an outbound call. The `result` field is one of:

- `human` — Short greeting followed by silence (likely a person).
- `machine` — Long greeting (likely voicemail or IVR).
- `no_speech` — No speech detected within the initial silence timeout.
- `not_sure` — Analysis timed out without a confident determination.

```json
{
  "type": "amd.result",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T12:00:00Z",
  "instance_id": "abc-123",
  "leg_id": "leg-456",
  "result": "machine",
  "initial_silence_ms": 120,
  "greeting_duration_ms": 1680,
  "total_analysis_ms": 1800
}
```

When `beep_timeout` is set and the result is `machine`, the `amd.result` event is sent immediately, then the analyzer continues listening for the voicemail beep tone (800–1200 Hz). If detected, a separate `amd.beep` event is emitted:

```json
{
  "type": "amd.beep",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T12:00:03Z",
  "instance_id": "abc-123",
  "leg_id": "leg-456",
  "beep_ms": 1400
}
```

The `beep_ms` field is the time from machine detection to beep detection. Use this event to know exactly when to start playing your voicemail message.

#### `leg.disconnected` — CDR-Style Structure

The `leg.disconnected` event uses a `cdr` object for disconnect reason and timing, plus an optional `quality` object for RTP metrics.

**Answered call with quality metrics:**

```json
{
  "type": "leg.disconnected",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T14:30:00.123Z",
  "instance_id": "inst-abc",
  "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "cdr": {
    "reason": "remote_bye",
    "duration_total": 125.43,
    "duration_answered": 120.10
  },
  "quality": {
    "mos_score": 4.21,
    "rtp_packets_received": 6025,
    "rtp_packets_lost": 12,
    "rtp_jitter_ms": 3.45
  }
}
```

**Unanswered call (no quality):**

```json
{
  "type": "leg.disconnected",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T14:30:08.650Z",
  "instance_id": "inst-abc",
  "leg_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "cdr": {
    "reason": "caller_cancel",
    "duration_total": 8.52,
    "duration_answered": 0
  }
}
```

#### `cdr` Object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `reason` | string | See **Disconnect Reasons** below |
| `duration_total` | float | Seconds from leg creation (INVITE sent/received) to disconnect |
| `duration_answered` | float | Seconds from answer (200 OK) to disconnect. `0` if the leg was never answered. |

#### `quality` Object (omitted when no media was received)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `mos_score` | float | Mean Opinion Score (1.0–5.0) estimated via simplified E-model (ITU-T G.107) from packet loss and jitter |

| `rtp_packets_lost` | integer | Estimated lost packets based on sequence number gaps |
| `rtp_jitter_ms` | float | Inter-arrival jitter in milliseconds (RFC 3550 §A.8) |

**Disconnect Reasons:**

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| `S3_ENDPOINT` | _(none)_ | Custom S3 endpoint for S3-compatible stores (MinIO, etc.) |
| `S3_PREFIX` | _(none)_ | Key prefix for S3 objects (e.g. `recordings/`) |
| `TTS_CACHE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable disk-backed TTS audio cache. Cached audio is stored on disk and persists across restarts. |
| `TTS_CACHE_DIR` | `/tmp/tts_cache` | Directory for cached TTS audio files. |
| `TTS_CACHE_INCLUDE_API_KEY` | `false` | Include API key in TTS cache key (set `true` if different keys map to different voice clones) |

## SIP Session Timers (RFC 4028)

- Accepts session timers requested by the remote UA (inbound and outbound)
- Minimum session interval: 90 seconds (`Min-SE`)
- Supports both `refresher=uac` and `refresher=uas` roles
- Re-INVITEs (including hold/unhold) reset the session timer
- Expired sessions disconnect with reason `session_expired`

---

## Typical Workflow

```
1. Configure global webhook via WEBHOOK_URL env var, or per-leg via request/SIP headers

2. Receive inbound call -> webhook: leg.ringing {leg_id, leg_type: "sip_inbound", from, to}

3. Answer the call
   POST /v1/legs/{leg_id}/answer

4. Attach an AI agent to the leg
   POST /v1/legs/{leg_id}/agent  {"agent_id": "your-agent-id"}

5. Agent converses with the caller. Webhooks deliver:
   - agent.connected {leg_id, conversation_id}
   - agent.user_transcript {leg_id, text}
   - agent.agent_response {leg_id, text}

6. Or: create a room for multi-party conferencing
   POST /v1/rooms  {"id": "conference-1"}

7. Add legs to the room
   POST /v1/rooms/conference-1/legs  {"leg_id": "..."}

8. Originate a second call and add to room
   POST /v1/legs  {"type": "sip", "uri": "sip:bob@10.0.0.1", "codecs": ["PCMU"]}
   POST /v1/rooms/conference-1/legs  {"leg_id": "..."}

9. Attach a room-level agent (hears everyone, speaks to everyone)
   POST /v1/rooms/conference-1/agent  {"agent_id": "your-agent-id"}

10. Start recording
    POST /v1/rooms/conference-1/record

11. Play announcement
    POST /v1/rooms/conference-1/play  {"url": "...", "mime_type": "audio/wav"}

12. Cleanup
    DELETE /v1/rooms/conference-1
```

## Metrics

### GET /metrics

Returns Prometheus-format metrics for the VoiceBlender instance. No request body or authentication is required.

**Response:** `200 OK` — Prometheus text exposition format (`text/plain; version=0.0.4`)

#### Exported Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `voiceblender_active_legs` | Gauge | — | Number of legs currently in any state (`ringing`, `early_media`, `connected`, `held`) |
| `voiceblender_active_rooms` | Gauge | — | Number of rooms currently open |
| `voiceblender_legs_total` | Counter | `type`, `state` | Total leg lifecycle transitions. `type`: `sip_inbound`, `sip_outbound`. `state`: `ringing`, `connected`, `disconnected` |
| `voiceblender_disconnect_reasons_total` | Counter | `type`, `reason` | Total disconnected legs by type and reason (e.g. `remote_bye`, `api_hangup`, `rtp_timeout`) |
| `voiceblender_call_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `type` | Answered call duration (time from answer to hangup). Use `rate(sum)/rate(count)` for ACD |
| `voiceblender_call_total_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `type` | Total leg lifetime including ringing time (time from leg creation to hangup) |
| Go runtime metrics | — | — | Standard `go_*` and `process_*` metrics from the Prometheus Go client |

#### PromQL Examples

Compute the Average Call Duration (ACD) over a 5-minute window:

```promql
rate(voiceblender_call_duration_seconds_sum[5m])
  / rate(voiceblender_call_duration_seconds_count[5m])
```

### Profiling (pprof)

Only available when the binary is built with the `pprof` build tag:

```
go build -tags pprof ./...
```

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /debug/pprof/` | Index of available profiles |
| `GET /debug/pprof/profile` | 30-second CPU profile |
| `GET /debug/pprof/heap` | Heap memory snapshot |
| `GET /debug/pprof/goroutine` | All goroutine stack traces |
| `GET /debug/pprof/trace` | Execution trace |
| `GET /debug/pprof/cmdline` | Process command line |

**Do not enable in production without access controls** — these endpoints expose internal runtime state.

```
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
```
