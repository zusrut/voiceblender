## Integration Tests

Integration tests spin up two full VoiceBlender instances (SIP + HTTP) on localhost with dynamic ports and make real SIP calls between them. No external services required.

### Run all integration tests

```bash
go test -tags integration -timeout 60s ./tests/integration/
```

The `-tags integration` flag is **required** — without it, the test files are skipped.

### Run with verbose output

```bash
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s ./tests/integration/
```

### Run a specific integration test

```bash
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestOutboundInbound_Connect ./tests/integration/
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestRecording ./tests/integration/
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestMute ./tests/integration/
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestDTMFBroadcast ./tests/integration/
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestRTT ./tests/integration/
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 60s -run TestWSEvents ./tests/integration/
```

### Integration test list

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TestOutboundInbound_Connect` | Basic SIP call: A dials B, B answers, both connect |
| `TestUseSourceSocket_RoundTripCall` | Smoke test for `SIP_USE_SOURCE_SOCKET=true`: end-to-end call setup, BYE, and disconnect events still complete with the flag enabled. Unit tests in `internal/sip/engine_test.go` (`TestEngine_PinDestinationToSource`) cover the destination-pinning logic itself. |
| `TestCall_IPv6Loopback` | Same as above, but both instances are bound to `[::1]` (IPv6 loopback). Skipped when the host has no IPv6 loopback. |

| `TestWSCommands_MuteLeg` | Mute/get_leg via WS; error on missing leg; error on unknown command |
| `TestWSEvents_AppIDFilter` | Two WS clients (filtered + unfiltered), two legs with different `app_id`; filtered client only sees matching events |

| `TestCodecSelect_AnswerWithExplicitCodec` | `POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer` honors a `codec` field in the request body |
| `TestCodecSelect_AnswerRejectsCodecNotInOffer` | Answer with a codec not in the remote offer returns 400 |
| `TestRing_ExplicitRingingThenAnswer` | Default `SIP_AUTO_RINGING=false`; multiple `/ring` calls send 180s, then `/answer` connects |
| `TestRing_AutoRingingPreservesLegacyFlow` | `SIP_AUTO_RINGING=true` restores auto-180 behavior; no explicit `/ring` needed |
| `TestRing_RejectsAfterAnswer` | `/ring` on a connected leg returns 409 |
| `TestWSLegInboundAutoConnect` | WebSocket client connects to `/v1/legs/websocket`, joins a room, exchanges audio + text, `headers` map captures X-/P- headers |
| `TestWSLegOutboundDialAndHeaders` | `POST /v1/legs` with `type:"websocket"` dials a remote WS echo server, verifies the echo server received the supplied X-Correlation-ID header |
| `TestWSLegOutboundDialFailure` | Outbound WS dial to a non-listening port produces a `leg.disconnected` event with a mapped reason |
| `TestWSLegAudioFlows` | Egress audio: WS leg joins a room, a tone playback runs into the room, the WS client reads binary PCM frames and asserts RMS is well above the silence floor |
| `TestWSLegAudioFlowsBidirectional` | Ingress + egress audio: two WS legs in the same room; client A streams a 1 kHz sine, client B reads PCM frames and asserts the sine survives the WS→mixer→WS round-trip (RMS above the silence floor) |
| `TestRoomWSCompatibleWithLegWS` | Confirms `/v1/rooms/{id}/ws` and `/v1/legs/websocket` speak the same wire protocol after both endpoints share `wsmedia.Transport`: a leg WS writer and a room WS reader exchange JSON-base64 audio (`{"audio":"<b64>"}` shape) end-to-end, including the welcome `connected` frame and the `{"type":"stop"}` close verb |

## AMD Accuracy Tests

The accuracy tests run the AMD analyzer directly against real audio files (no SIP transport) to measure classification accuracy at scale. They require test data to be downloaded or generated first.

### Test data setup

```bash
# Download voicemail greeting recordings (machine-expected)
make download-greetings

# Generate short human greeting WAV files via ElevenLabs TTS (human-expected)
# Requires ELEVENLABS_API_KEY — generates 46 greetings in 11 languages with 3s trailing silence
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk-... make gen-human-greetings
```

Test data is stored in `tests/data/greetings/` and gitignored. Directory structure:

```
tests/data/greetings/
  frankj-dob/       # 7 MP3 voicemail greetings (expected: machine)
  gavvllaw/         # 34 MP3/WAV voicemail greetings (expected: machine)
  chetaniitbhilai/  # 7 WAV voicemail greetings (expected: machine)
  human/            # 46 WAV short human greetings in 11 languages (expected: human)
```

### Run accuracy tests

```bash
# Voicemail greetings — expected: machine (requires make download-greetings)
go test -tags integration -v -run TestAMD_Accuracy ./tests/integration/

# Human greetings — expected: human (requires make gen-human-greetings)
go test -tags integration -v -run TestAMD_FalsePositives ./tests/integration/

# Combined report — both machine and human sources
go test -tags integration -v -run TestAMD_AccuracyAll ./tests/integration/
```

Tests skip automatically if the required test data is not present.

### Accuracy test list

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TestAMD_Accuracy` | Voicemail greetings (48 files, 3 sources) — expected `machine` |
| `TestAMD_FalsePositives` | Human greetings (46 files, 11 languages) — expected `human` |
| `TestAMD_AccuracyAll` | Combined report across all sources |

### Example output

```
=== AMD Accuracy Report ===
Total files:  94
Correct:      93
Accuracy:     98.9%

  frankj-dob           7/7 (100%)   [expected: machine]

## Benchmark / Scaling Test

The scaling benchmark creates many concurrent rooms with 2 SIP legs each and measures:

- **Setup throughput** — rooms/sec and per-room latency percentiles
- **Resource usage** — goroutines and heap allocation at each stage
- **CPU usage** — process CPU consumed during the steady-state sustain phase, normalized as % of one core, % of all cores, and µs of CPU per room-second (linux/darwin only, via `getrusage`)
- **Call quality** — per-leg MOS score, RTP jitter, and packet loss aggregated from `leg.disconnected` events (min/avg/p50/p95 across all legs, both instances)
- **Audio latency** — end-to-end impulse injection through the full SIP + mixer path, located via cross-correlation against the known impulse waveform (immune to codec pre-ringing)
- **Connection health** — verifies all legs remain connected under load
- **Teardown throughput** — cleanup speed

### Run the full benchmark (default scales: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 rooms)

```bash
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/
```

### Custom room counts

Use the `-bench-rooms` flag or `BENCH_ROOMS` env var to specify a comma-separated list of room counts:

```bash
# Single custom scale
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/ -bench-rooms=200

# Multiple custom scales
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 600s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/ -bench-rooms=50,100,200,500

# Via environment variable
BENCH_ROOMS=500 go test -tags integration -v -timeout 600s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/
```

For large room counts, increase the timeout accordingly (~1s per 10 rooms for setup + 3s sustain + latency measurement per scale).

### Run a single scale from the default set

```bash
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s -run 'TestConcurrentRoomsScale/rooms_25$' ./tests/integration/
```

### Opus codec variant

`TestConcurrentRoomsScaleOpus` runs the same workload but negotiates the **Opus** codec on every leg (48 kHz native, gopus encode/decode, 6× resampling to/from the 16 kHz mixer). It accepts the same `-bench-rooms` / `BENCH_ROOMS`, `-bench-latency-rooms`, and `-bench-latency-trials` flags. Compare its log output against `TestConcurrentRoomsScale` (PCMU baseline) to characterize codec-path overhead.

```bash
# Default scales with Opus
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScaleOpus ./tests/integration/

# Custom scales
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 600s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScaleOpus ./tests/integration/ -bench-rooms=50,100,200

# Side-by-side PCMU vs Opus at one scale
BENCH_ROOMS=50 go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run 'TestConcurrentRoomsScale(Opus)?$' ./tests/integration/
```

### Dedicated Opus latency test

`TestOpusAudioLatency` characterizes the Opus codec round-trip with a single 2-leg room and many trials (default 100), reporting min/avg/p50/p90/p95/p99/max/stddev. Runs without the throughput stress of the scale benchmark, giving a clean distribution.

```bash
# Default 100 trials (~30s)
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s -run TestOpusAudioLatency ./tests/integration/

# Custom trial count
OPUS_LATENCY_TRIALS=500 go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run TestOpusAudioLatency ./tests/integration/
```

### Audio latency measurement

The benchmark measures leg-to-leg audio latency by:

1. Injecting a 1kHz sine impulse into one leg via `SIPLeg.AudioWriter()` on instance B
2. Detecting it at the other leg's mixer output tap (`SetParticipantOutTap`) on instance A
3. Measuring the time delta

This covers the full path: `B.writeLoop → RTP → A.readLoop → resample → mixer → participantOutTap`.

By default, up to 10 rooms are sampled, 3 trials each, for up to 30 latency measurements per scale.

Use `-bench-latency-rooms` and `-bench-latency-trials` flags (or `BENCH_LATENCY_ROOMS` / `BENCH_LATENCY_TRIALS` env vars) to customize:

```bash
# Sample all 50 rooms, 5 trials each
go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/ -bench-rooms=50 -bench-latency-rooms=50 -bench-latency-trials=5

# Via environment variables
BENCH_LATENCY_ROOMS=20 BENCH_LATENCY_TRIALS=5 go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s -run TestConcurrentRoomsScale ./tests/integration/
```

### Example output

```
Phase 1 — Setup: 100 rooms in 3.7s (26.9 rooms/sec)
  call+room setup latency: avg=570ms p50=615ms p95=728ms p99=751ms max=751ms (n=100)
  Goroutines: 1914
  Heap alloc: 19.0 MB (delta: 8.0 MB)
Phase 2 — Sustaining 100 rooms for 3s...
  All 200 calls still connected
Phase 3 — Measuring audio latency...
  audio leg-to-leg latency: avg=20ms p50=10ms p95=62ms p99=64ms max=64ms (n=30)
Phase 4 — Teardown: 100 rooms in 5.6ms (17782 rooms/sec)
```

---

## CI / All Tests

To run everything in one command:

```bash
go test ./internal/... && go test -tags integration -v -timeout 120s ./tests/integration/ -count=1
```

Add `-count=1` to disable test caching.

To include the scaling benchmark (adds ~40s):

```bash
go test ./internal/... && go test -tags integration -v -timeout 300s ./tests/integration/ -count=1
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Tests hang or timeout:** Integration tests use loopback UDP for SIP. If the system firewall blocks localhost UDP, tests will timeout waiting for SIP responses. Increase timeout with `-timeout 120s` on slower machines.

**Port conflicts:** Each test instance picks random free UDP/TCP ports. Conflicts are unlikely but possible under heavy system load. Re-running usually resolves this.

**`no test files` for integration tests:** You forgot `-tags integration`. The test files have a `//go:build integration` constraint.

---

## Manual RTT (Real-Time Text) Interop

Automated coverage exercises VoiceBlender against itself. To verify wire-level interop with a third-party SIP UA, [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/) is the most reliable open-source RFC 4103 implementation:

1. Start VoiceBlender with `RTT_ENABLED=true` and a webhook receiver listening for `rtt.received`.
2. In Linphone, enable Real-Time Text in account settings, then call into VoiceBlender's SIP port.
3. Answer the call via the REST API: `POST /v1/legs/{id}/answer`.
4. Type in Linphone's RTT pane — observe `rtt.received` events arriving at your webhook with the typed text and a monotonically increasing `seq`.
5. Send text from VoiceBlender:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/legs/<leg_id>/rtt \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"text":"hello"}'
   ```

   The text appears in Linphone's RTT pane.
6. To verify RFC 2198 redundancy, force packet loss on loopback before step 4:
   ```bash
   sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem loss 10%
   # ... run the test ...
   sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root netem
   ```
   Most characters should still arrive; bursts of loss show up as the U+FFFD replacement character with `loss_marker: true` on the event.
